# Treasure Hunting

Treasure Hunting is supposed to be a small game.
Originally it was played in school by a few bored teenagers, with pen and paper - but we want to bring it on screen!
This is actually the 5th edition of Treasure Hunting, but the second to be realized digitally.
A new version was started, because this one will be in python2.
It is not yet decided, which engine will be used.

# About

In the world of Treasure Hunting, vampires, werewolves, angels, and several other supernatural entities (SUPs) were living among humans undetected.
Since their detection through a recommended scientist with peaceful intentions, their status is complicated.
Racist groups are afraid of them and convinced most states to hunt SUPs down and kill them all.
But that is not the fate of most SUPs - usually they are used by corporations and other militant groups as effective mercenaries or for research purposes.
You are playing one of these soldiers, and are deciding their fate in a world full of corporate interests, racist hostilities and violence.
