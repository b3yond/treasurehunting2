# Magic

There are a lot of words which can be used to describe a spell.
These words are then interpreted by the computer, who creates an effect.

A working spell has these components:

Target
Effect
Intensity
Condition
Probability

If the caster doesn't specify all criteria, the computer decides what exactly happens and how the rest is computed.
Every spell also costs Mana Points, which are calculated out of the effect of the resulting spell.
Every spell word costs as much APs, as much syllables it has.

# Grammar

the order of the words has to be:
probability effect condition target intensity done!

other words have to be related to some of these, and then always have to be before their relation word.
all human
not me


possible sentences are:

sure burn all human much
sleep three police three
stun police melee

wrong sentences are:

human sleep     # before effect can only be a probability word, no target.
much heal me    # much isn't a intensity word at that place and can't be related to heal.
